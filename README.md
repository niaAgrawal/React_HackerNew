# React_HackerNews

Project
This is a (soft) "Hacker News" clone.

You can view the final project at hn.ui.dev


You will need to use React's dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop to show the HTML posts that the API gives you. We didn't cover it in the course but you can read about it here.

The only thing that you'll need is the documentation for the Hacker News API.
